# RecipeZ

This project aims to offer food pairing ideas based on an ingrediants shared flavor compounds taken from [FlavorDB](https://cosylab.iiitd.edu.in/flavordb/) and ran through [Racklog](https://docs.racket-lang.org/racklog/). Western Cuisine tends to have recipes with many flavor compounds [0] so this should provide flavourful yet somewhat unexpected matches. 

Disclaimer: This might also suggest totally terrible ideas that you just shouldn't eat because it'll be nasty. Chefs common sense must apply! I shall not be held responsible because of your deep-fried chocolate octopus ;)
