# RecipeZ

This project aims to offer food pairing ideas based on an ingrediants shared flavor compounds taken from [FlavorDB](https://cosylab.iiitd.edu.in/flavordb/) and ran through [Racklog](https://docs.racket-lang.org/racklog/). Western Cuisine tends to have recipes with many flavor compounds [0] so this should provide genuine and somewhat unexpected matches.
